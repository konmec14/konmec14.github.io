		<h2>Meet my lovely dog!</h2>
		<h5>General</h5>
		<p>Two years ago we tried to find a dog, which meets all the requirements
		that all four of us at home set. First thing, we wanted a female dog. Why? 
		Well, just because. The next thing was, she had to have short hair and 
		shouldn't be too big. The breed itself didn't really matter. But it had to
		be a puppy, as we wanted a dog, that is used to us since puppyhood.</p>
		<h5>After finding her</h5>
		<p>Us looking for a dog already goes back two years now. And at this very 
		time we are truly happy to have found what we were looking for. And she had it all:</p>

		</ul>
